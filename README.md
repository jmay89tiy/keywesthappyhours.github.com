A wonderful little tourism tool for finding cheap drinks and food in Key West Florida

This serves as a temporary home for a miniature portfolio. I just wanted to showcase some of the things I've managed to learn while pursuing my career as a junior developer. Lots of fun projects and skill sets make up most of my past year as a student of code. 
I hope you enjoy it, and I would love to hear from you if you find anything particularly outstanding or inspiring.
